    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>Understanding JavaScript as a Practical Object</h2>
    <h3>Objects</h3>
    <p>
      Javascript essentially behaves with an object the same way we humans
      interact with an object. So moving ahead I will be taking example of a
      Backpack to understand the different concepts.
    </p>
    <h4>Object Container</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Backpack is an object. This object has different properties which
        includes color, volume, name, etc. This object also has different
        features like opening and closing. Backpack object can also contain
        another object inside it, which can have properties of its own.
      </li>
      <li>
        The backpack obviously requires a place, maybe a box. So, we use
        variable, such as <code><mark>constbackpack = {</mark></code
        >. The variable that we are using here is <strong>Constant</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The name backpack is very generic, it does not define the exact type of
        the object. So, the backpack needs a name and every object needs a
        name.<img

          alt="JavaScript container format"
          height="50px"
          width="250px"
          id="figure 1"
        />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When we create an object, we want to improve it and for that we may want
      to change its property. But, we will not remove or change the object.<mark
        >Therefore, we use the Constant variable to denote the object remains
        constant. Most objects in JavaScripts are constants.</mark
      >
    </p>
    <h4>Object Properties</h4>
    <p>
      Literally mean the properties of an object. Define the different
      properties of an object
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The correct way of writing the properties is explained in the picture
        <a href="./Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 7.26.41 PM.png">here</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Avoid code issues by using camelCase for property names.</li>
      <li>
        Write each property in a different line. Seperate each property with a
        comma
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="info">
      <p class="note1">
        <strong>Note!</strong> use <code>console.log(object)</code> to call the
        object on console by default
      </p>
    </div>
  </body>
